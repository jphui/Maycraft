# Mayflower

Mayflower is a side scrolling platformer game developed by Leo Bala, Jonathan Hui, and Naren Gundapaneni. It combines the mechanics of Super Mario World, includes concepts from Minecraft, and stars our awesome CSIII teacher Mr. May.

Mayflower showcases creativity alongside technical capability. The game employs important aspects of object-oriented design and taught us the importance of managing a large multi-file project as well as team-based workflow. The development process also cultivated the skill of reading and using API documentation of a simple game engine (mayflower) created by our teacher Mr. May.
